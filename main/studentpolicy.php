                                </br>

                                • All applications to the companies are to be made only through online system of the Campus Recruitment System. If a student does not Register on website , he/she will not be allowed to participate in the Placement Cell.</br>
                                • A student can apply to a maximum of 10 companies (default) on campus. A warning would be issued as one crosses 8 applications.</br>
                                • After a student has exhausted his/her quota of 10 applications and desires to make further applications:
                                </br>
                                (1) He/she will be required to approach his/her concerned authority and Head and obtain in writing a letter certifying the need of the student to obtain more applications in a standard format. (2) Only on receipt of such a request, would Placement Cell consider and add 5 more applications to the student quota of applications.</br>
                                <h3 style="color:red">Business Rules for Withdrawing an Application:</h3> The student may withdraw his/her application from a company on campus subject to the following rules and regulations:</br>
                                • The student can withdraw his/her application to a company only if the last date of application to that particular company is not over.</br>
                                • The student may withdraw from any or all companies without any limits, but only before the last date of application to company/companies concerned.</br>
                                • The student may also reapply to a company that he/she had earlier withdrawn from, provided he/she has not exceeded his/her application quota and application deadline for the company is not over.</br>
                                <h3 style="color:red">Business Rules for Selection Process:</h3> • One student is allowed to secure only one job if the gross package is more than 4 lakh per annum. If the gross amount offered is less than or equal to 4 lakh per annum, he/she is eligible to apply for a company whose gross amount is more than 4 lakh per annum. And therefore after one secures a job with gross greater than 4 lakh per annum, one would be automatically deregistered from that day onwards.</br>
                                • As more than one company would be visiting the campus, there may be a possibility that one student secures more than one job on the same day. Therefore:</br>
                                1. Each eligible student will be required to fill up his/her individual preferences in advance for each placement day, ranking the companies he/she has applied to/ has been shortlisted on a particular day, in the descending order of his/her choice. The preferences are editable till a day before by 23:59 hrs.</br> 2. These preferences shall be used in case: </br>a. The student gets selected in more than one company on the same placement day.</br> b. Company wants to make an on the spot offer to the student before the selection procedure for the day is over.
                                </br>
                                • In case a student gets selected in 2 or more companies on the same day, then the company ranked higher in the preference order of the student will be the one where the student would be finally considered placed.</br>
                                • In case a company decides to offer the student an on the spot job offer before the entire placement process for that day is over then he/she will not be allowed to appear further for the placement process of the other companies which were ranked lower in preference than the company that made on the spot offer . The student will, however, be allowed to appear in such company/companies, which were higher in preference order than the one which offered the job.</br>
                                • In case a student does not fill the preference order for a placement day, then the allotment will be down by the electronic system and he/she will not be allowed to continue to appear for the placement process of the other companies.</br>
                                In case a company does not give its final selection list on the same day it visits the campus, then the students will be allowed to appear in other companies visiting on subsequent days till they finally get selected . However, if a student has already been selected by a company that came on the subsequent day and the company that deferred its decisional so makes an offer to him/her later on,then:</br>
                                • In case more than one result of selected student(s) comes on the same day,then the student will be given an option to choose between company of the previous day and the company of the day.</br>
                                • In case the result of the company (which deferred its selection process) gives its result on a day later than the day when the student was selected by another company, this late offer will be rejected and the company would be informed.

                                <h3 style="color:red">Student Conduct and Disciplinary Policy:</h3> Absenteeism rules and policy:</br>
                                For absenteeism in any test,interview or any selection process which an applicant has to attend as part of a companys recruiting procedure the following minimum penal action would apply:
